// BrowserRouter component handles routing by storing the routing context in the browser URL and implements backward/forward navigation -- the App component needs to be wrapped in browser router (done in index.js in this case, can also be done here if you wrap Routes component in BrowserRouter component)

// routes wraps all routes you want to define -- anything outside of the Routes section doesn't re-render -- the whole page doesnt refresh, just whatever is wrapped in your routes

// route defines your routes (path to diff page on website) -- whatever is passed as the value of the attribute component gets rendered when you follow the path

// Link components give the navigation --- replaces anchor tags, swaps things out without refreshing your entire application -- to replaces the href

export default App;
